## What is the English Premier Visualizer App

This Shiny App is for visulizating English Premier League information from year 1993 to 2015.
The dataset is from [Football-Data.co.uk](http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php) that contains the basic information of each year results that has been merged for the Shiny App.  

Data Source: http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php  
**Note**: Since I didn't use the API to collect data, the current data might not be 100% accurate and every year is an individual file.
Date updated: 05/24/2015
